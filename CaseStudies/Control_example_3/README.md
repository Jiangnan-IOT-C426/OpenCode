## Instructions for use:

1. Place the files *Control_Operator.m* *Select_Parameter.m*  *main.m* *kutta_predict.m* *JacobianH.m* *JacobianF.m* *sys.m* under the MATLAB running path.

2. *Control_Operator.m* and *Select_Parameter.m* are the API files corresponding to MATLAB. 

   *main.m* is the main file of QA control.  

   *kutta_predict.m* is  chlorophyll a fluorescence value output based on the model.

   *JacobianF.m* is the matrix of the state equation

   *JacobianH.m* is the matrix of the measurement equation

   *sys.m* is the photosynthesis model composed of 7 state variables, after Feng et al. (2018)
